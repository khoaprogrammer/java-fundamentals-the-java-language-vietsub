Hi everyone. My name is Jim Wilson. Welcome to my course, Java Fundamentals: The Java Language.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm president of JW Hedgehog, Incorporated and I've had the good fortune to have been a professional software

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
developer now for more than 30 years.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Did you know that Java is the most sought after programming language skill among software developers?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Java is supported on everything from smartphones to servers to many of the special purpose devices that make up

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the inner node of things.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In addition to being important to software developers, a recent survey listed Java as one of the five most

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
important skills for data scientists, those folks who work their way through all of that big data.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In this course we're going to teach you everything you need to know to get started working in the Java

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
programming language.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So the major topics we cover include setting up your Java development environment, language constructs &amp;

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
control flow, classes, class inheritance, &amp; interfaces, exceptions &amp; error handling, creating &amp; using Java packages.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
By the end of this course you'll be ready to begin working in any of the many environments that rely on

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
the Java programming language. This is a beginning course

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and therefore makes no assumptions on prior programming experience. I hope you'll join me as we learn

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Java programming with the course, Java Fundamentals: The Java Language, at Pluralsight.
