1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's go ahead and walk through the installation

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
of the NetBeans IDE.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now as I mentioned you can download NetBeans with the JDK.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And that same URL we used earlier to get the most recent JDK

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
works for getting the most recent packaging

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
of NetBeans and the JDK.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So that same bit.ly/psjdkdownload.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If you want to actually kind of pick which

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
configuration of NetBeans you want

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
as opposed to getting the one that's got JDK build into it

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
you can go to the netbeans.org website

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
on their download page.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You actually pick out exactly what

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
configuration of NetBeans you want.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
OK so let's go through the steps.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
OK so here we are in our browser.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's go ahead and go to that bit.ly URL again.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So hit Enter.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So here on your Oracle download page

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
you see the big logo there that says NetBeans.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And it says NetBeans with JDK.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So let's go ahead and go there and see what that looks like.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So click on that.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And you'll notice here that right here

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
in the center of the page.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It actually says that here's the JDK with NetBeans.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And it's got all the different platform installations.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But looking to the right here

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
you'll see there's actually a link

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that just says NetBeans IDE.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So let's take a look at that guy real quick.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So we're going to go to that page.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That puts us over in the NetBeans website itself.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to scroll down a little bit.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And you can see there that

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
these are all the different configurations

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that we can download for the different platforms, right?

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For just SE Support or if you want

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
EE Support as well, and other ones.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So if you want to Control

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
then pick that particular configuration.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You can do that from here.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What I'm going to do though is

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
go back to the page we were on.

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I'm going to go ahead and install NetBeans with the JDK.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now remember in the earlier Demo

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I installed the JDK all by itself.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Because that step was already done

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't have to actually download

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
this package version of it.

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can actually just go get NetBeans by itself.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So I'm going to go in here and go get the version

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
for the current computer.

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Which is again a 64 bit Windows

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and I'll download that.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So I have the download now.

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So let's go ahead and run that.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Alright, so we're in the installer.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's go ahead and click through that.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now we have to accept the license

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
for some of the tools here.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So JUnit is a testing tool

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and that gets installed as part of the ID.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So we're just going to go ahead and accept that license.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Click Next.

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Again telling it where to install the JDK.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We'll say yep do that.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now it wants to know where to install

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
NetBeans and some JDK Support stuff for NetBeans.

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We're going to click Next on that.

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And the last one here is that

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
"Do you want to check for Updates?"

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And I leave that checked.

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Go ahead and click Install.

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Alright, so our setup is complete.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And the last thing it's asking us is just

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
do we what to go ahead contribute statistics

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
back into the project so they can see what we're using.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So I'm going to leave that box checked and say Finish.

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I now have the NetBeans ID installed.

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now one thing to be aware of is that

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
NetBeans installation is a fairly lengthy installation.

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm on a pretty new machine here

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and it probably still took between

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
three and four minutes for that install to run.

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So if it takes a few minutes to run

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
don't be worried about it.

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So let's go and fire up NetBeans now

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and see what it looks like.

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll go down here to my Windows.

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and just go down to where all my programs are.

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Scroll over here to my NetBeans.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There's NetBeans.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So let's go ahead and run that guy.

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And there we have it.

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We've been NetBeans installed and it's running for us.

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We'll actually build a program with it in the next module.

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But I just wanted to make sure

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that it installed and ran correctly, and it does.
