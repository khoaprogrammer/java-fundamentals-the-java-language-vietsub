1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first thing we need to understand to get started is

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
exactly what is Java.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
When someone says Java, what are they talking about?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, Java is a Programming Language.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But Java's also a Runtime Environment.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's actually both of those things.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So when we think about the programming language

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
it has things like the Syntax, the Data types, Control flow

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
like Looping and Conditional statements

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and being Object- orientated, right?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Doing Inheritance and so forth.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And then RunTime of course has to support those things.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But also provides things like Configuration, Security

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
a Threading Model, Input/output, that sort of thing.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So when someone says Java, they could be referring to

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a Programming Language or the Runtime Environment

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
or the whole thing.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now in general, Runtime Environment is when someone's

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
talking about when they just say Java.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Which is often referred to as Java Standard Edition.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Or kind of the basic Java Environment.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But Oracle provides other environments to derive from that.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Enterprise Edition, Java Micro Edition, and JavaFX, right?

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So those are all either supersets

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or subsets of this main thing

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which is just a Java Standard Edition.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But the thing that's neat about Java, it's so flexible.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That there are even Runtimes that are not tied

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to the Java one produced by Oracle, right?

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Like Android is kind of the most well-known one, right?

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Androids provides a very different Runtime

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Than the Standard Java Runtimes from Oracle.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The thing is though, that all those environments support

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
effectively the same Java Programming Language, right?

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So that one Language equips us to work in all those different places.
