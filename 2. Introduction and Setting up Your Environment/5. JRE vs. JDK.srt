1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The JRE and the JDK are two terms

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
you hear people mention very frequently in the Java World.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And what they are is a two parts that we need in order

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to run and create Java Applications.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The JRE is the Java Runtime Environment.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
JDK is the Java Developing Kit.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And so the JRE is what you require

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
in order to run Java Applications.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And users normally install the JRE.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They're the ones who are going to run our apps.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The JDK provides the tools required to create Java apps.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So normally developers the ones who install

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the JDK on their machines.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And in order to develop the apps you need to run them

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the JDK installation includes a JRE.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So how does all this work together?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If we sit down and we type out up a Java Source File

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
with our program code inside of it.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And we want to go and run that in some Host Environment how do we do it?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That Host Environment might be Windows, Linux.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It could be Mac.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It could even be a browser.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It might be a phone running Android.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How do we get from that Source we typed up

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to something we could actually run

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
on Mac or another computer.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well that's where the Java Development Kit comes in.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Using the Java Development Kit

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
we can feed our Source Code into it.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And it will produce our Java application.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Now Java's not like a low level language like C.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
C, when you compile a C program

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
it produces an application that can

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
run directly on the Host computer.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Java uses an abstraction called Blake Codes

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that's platform independent.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It allows us to not be tied to a particular Host Environment

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but actually have something that

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
can be run in different Host Environments.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And that's where the Java Runtime Environment comes in.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The Java Runtime Environment provides what we need

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
in order for our Java app that does

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Blake Codes to execute in any Host Environment.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's why End-users install the Java Runtime Environment

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
because they just need to run that code.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We as developers install the JDK

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to give us the tools to produce that application.
