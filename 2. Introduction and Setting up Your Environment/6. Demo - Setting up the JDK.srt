1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's go and install the JDK onto our machine.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now that URL I have on screen

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the bit.ly/psjdkdownload is set to point to

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
whatever the current version of the JDK is.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As I'm recording this, the current version is JDK8.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So that's the one I'll install.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you watch this course into the future

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and another version JDK 9 or 10 comes out,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that same URL you see will take you

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to the appropriate place to download that current version.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So here we are in our browser.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So let's go ahead and put in that URL.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We'll hit enter.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So here we are at the current download page.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Or I should say, here we are at the page

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
where you can get the current Java downloads.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You notice here on the left we got one here for the JDK.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Also called the Java Platforms.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We'll go ahead and click on that.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Here we are on the JDK download page.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So go ahead and scroll down here a little bit

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
until you see that--

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
here's all the various versions you can download.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And basically you just download the version

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
for whatever platform you're using, right?

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If you're on Linux you get that one of course.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If I was on my Mac right now I'd get the Mac one.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But in this case I'm currently on a 64 bit Windows machine.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So I want to install that version, right?

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Windows 64.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
One thing you want to make sure you remember to do

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
is accept this license, alright?

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If you don't accept the license

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
it won't allow you to do the download.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
When we're ready we just go ahead

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and click on this to download the File.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So my download's completed.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I'm going to go ahead and run the installer.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm just going to go ahead and double click on this guy.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And now here we are inside the installer, right?

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I'm just going to get in and let the

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
installer get started here.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, good.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Say, yep good, install everything.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And you'll notice that one of the things it has here

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is that the JRE or the Java Runtime.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So it actually puts that in for us.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So we're going to say yep, and go ahead and do that.

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You notice here, it prompts us again

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
for a Destination Folder.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And this is the folder where

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the Java Runtime is going to go.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to go ahead, and just accept the default for that.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So I'll say Next.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And with that we're done.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We now have the JDK along with the JRE

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:59:00,000
installed on our computer.
