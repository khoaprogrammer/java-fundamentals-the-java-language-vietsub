1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's walk through installing

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
the IntelliJ Community Edition.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The URL on screen there, the bitly URL will take

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
you to whatever the current version of IntelliJ is.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Currently it's 14.1.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But even as the versions evolve

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that URL should still remain valid.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here we are in our browser.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So let's go ahead and put that URL in

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and get to the IntelliJ page.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We hit Enter.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Just scroll down a little bit here

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so you can see where we're at.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You see this one page.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And it's got both the Commercial Edition

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and the Community Edition.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Want to make sure we go ahead

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and download the Community Edition.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So we just go ahead and click on the download button here.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Once the download's complete

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we just go ahead and run the installer.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So we'll just step through this now so I'll start.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll click Next.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm going to go ahead and accept the

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Default Installation Folder.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now I'm going to go ahead and create a desktop shortcut

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to make it a little easier to find.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And also I've got these associations

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
so I'm going to go ahead and associate with .java.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That way if I just double click on any .java File

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it'll automatically Open it up inside of IntelliJ.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Click Next.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to keep all the defaults here on the Groups.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And it's off and installing.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So my installation's complete.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So I'm going to go ahead here and just click this box

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
that says go ahead and run IntelliJ when I exit.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I'll click finish.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm going to tell it not to worry about

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
importing any previous settings.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm just going to say OK.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now the first time you run it

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
it wants to ask you how do you want set it up.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Do you want to customize its appearance and everything.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm just going to say just skip all that

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and just set the defaults.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And see now I'm at the starting window.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now we have IntelliJ installed as well.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And again in the next module

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We'll actually start using this

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and building some Code with it.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We now know we have a successful install.
