1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To wrap up, the key to remember here

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is that when we talk about Java

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Java actually comes as both a language

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and a Runtime Environment.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You know there may be some variations

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
in those individual Runtime Environments.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But the cool thing is that the

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
language is pretty consistent.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
By knowing the Java Language well

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
you've got the ability to work

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
across a wide range of platforms.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now in terms of installations, End-users only require

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the JRE that Java Runtime Environment.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
As Developers we want the JDK as well.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Remember that the JDK installation

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
installs the JRE for you

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so you can go ahead and run the

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
applications that you're creating.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All although the JDK is all we actually need

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to create our applications.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We probably want to use an IDE of some sort.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There's a whole bunch of ones out there.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Again you pick the one you like best.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Out of the two I showed you

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
One is NetBeans which is the one that Oracle provides.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The other one when I showed you IntelliJ

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
is again very popular as well.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And there's no magic to it.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It really comes to down to,

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
you just pick the one you like best.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And with that, we have everything we need

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
to set up our Environments.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So in the next module we'll start Coding.
