1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our focus throughout this whole course

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is we're going to give you a strong foundation

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in the Java Language.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
To teach you what you need to work effectively

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
with the Java programming language.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to do that as a very Hands-on approach.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're going to be writing lots of code as we go through.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And seeing what happens when we

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
write and change that code.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And our focus is really here on this again

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the idea of the language, right?

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The Java syntax, the language constructs, the concepts

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and how to use all those things

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
together to program effectively.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And what we're really trying to do here

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
is give you the language skills you need to work effectively

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in any Java-based environments.

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The topics we cover here are useful in traditional Java.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Which is often called Java Standard Edition.

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But also when working in Enterprise Level Applications

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
even Java Smart Client Applications, right?

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And that carries on even down to small devices

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
with Java Micro Edition and Android, right?

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So we really got that whole thing covered.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The thing that's interesting to note is that

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
even though Android is really kind of

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the most popular phone platform that uses Java.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That doesn't mean that Java Micro Edition

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
isn't important, right?

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Although Java Micro Edition is

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
not a big part of phones anymore

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
it still plays a really important role in smart devices

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and the internet of things, right?

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So understanding the Java programming language

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
really gives you what you need to work across all

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
all levels of computers, right?

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
From desktops all the way down to

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:59:00,000
small devices all way back up to great big servers.
