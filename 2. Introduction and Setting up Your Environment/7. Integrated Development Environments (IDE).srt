1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If you wanted to, you could build your Java applications

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
having only installed the JDK.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You could've used some arbitrary text editor

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to type in your program code.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And then you can use command line tools

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to do all the compiling and executing of your programs.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And that would work fine.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And people did that for years.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And some people still do that.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But in general, for developing we want to

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
use a more productive model than that.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We like these things called

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Integrated Development Environments

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that allow us to type in our Code

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
compile it, debug it, everything all in one place.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now Java has lots and lots of IDEs available.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Two of the most popular are NetBeans and IntelliJ.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And both of these are available for free.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
NetBeans is the IDE that Oracle themselves provide.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And they provide it for free.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And it's pretty flexible in a sense that it comes

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
in different configurations.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And configurations are available kind of

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
for all the Oracle Javas.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So Standard Edition, Enterprise Edition,

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Micro Edition, JavaFX.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And you can add all those in at no additional cost.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The one kind of popular Java Environment

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that it does not support is Android.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Alright, just to be aware of that if you were doing

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Android development and other Java development

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you wouldn't be able to use NetBeans

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
for the Android part of it.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
One kind of nicety is that Oracle does provide

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
a single installer that has both the JDK

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and the Java SE bundle of NetBeans.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In other words that version of NetBeans

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
will let you work on Java SE programs.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And that's just a real kind of nicety nice convenience

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
if you're installing a new machine.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And you just want to kind of get the JDK on there

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and have an ID all in one install.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It just makes setting up a machine easy.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Another very popular IDE for Java is IntelliJ.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I really like IntelliJ.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's my preferred Java Environment.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Now the IntelliJ Community Edition

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
is a free version of a commercial product.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So you have a company called JetBrains

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
actually builds and sales a full blown

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
installation of IntelliJ.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But they make this Community Edition

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
available to us for free.

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And what I like about it is that

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
the Community Edition supports

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Java Standard Edition and Android.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So you can use one IDE for both of those environments.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Which I find really convenient.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you were to decide to go ahead and go

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
with the commercial version of IntelliJ

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you would pick up addition features.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's some other development features.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Like Java EE does some cool server debugging stuff.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But you don't have to go to the commercial version.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Community Edition is quite substantial.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And certainly is good enough for everything we do in this course.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You'll find that most things you likely want to do

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:59:00,000
are supported in the Community Edition.
