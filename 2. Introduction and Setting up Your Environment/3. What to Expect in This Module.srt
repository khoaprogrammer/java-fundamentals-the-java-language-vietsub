1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The goal of this first Module is to give us the information

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we need to start working with and learning

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the Java programming language.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So first we want to look at

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
is just take a brief overview of what Java is.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What are the parts of it, what is it made up of.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then I'll talk about the JRE vs. JDK.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Two terms people throw around pretty freely

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
in a Java world.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We want to understand what those are and what they mean.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're going to look at the details of actually

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
setting up you Java development environment.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And then looking at your Java

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Integrative Development Environment.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The tools we use to build Java programs.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We're not going to kind of endorse or focus on any

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Java, or any specific Java ID in this course.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We just want to talk about what the options are out there

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and help you to choose which one's right for you.
