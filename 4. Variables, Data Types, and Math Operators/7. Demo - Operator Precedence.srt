1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To get a better sense of how operator precedence works,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
let's take a look at some code.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We have simple program here

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
with four variables declared at the top.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What we want to do is set up some math operations

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and see how the order of precedence

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
affects the result we get.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's go ahead and declare an integer for a result.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So I'll just call that result1.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What you want to do here

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
is you want to take the variable valA,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
then I'm going to go ahead and subtract valB from it,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and then I'll divide that by valC.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now I'm going to go ahead and just duplicate that now

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so I have another one just like it.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Call this one result2.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And all I'm going to do

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
is put a parenthesis in,

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
put a parenthesis around valA and valB here.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
All right we have these parenthesis in place,

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so the last thing we want to do

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is just go ahead and print these guys out.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
All right, so let's go ahead and run it.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And as we run it,

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
you can see that we get two very different results.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The first one, result1, gives us a value of 19.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The second one, result2, gives us a value of 5.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What's happening there?

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well on the first line, where we set result1,

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
remember that multiplicative operations

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
take precedence over additive operations.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So division is a multiplicative operation,

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
so basically valueB, which is 6,

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
was divided by valueC, which is 3,

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
which gave us the result of 2.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So then we subtracted that 2 from valA, which is 21,

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
giving us 19.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The second one, result2, because of the parenthesis,

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
we overrode that normal order of operations.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
As a result, we first subtracted 6 from 21,

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
which gave us 15,

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and then we divided that by 3,

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
which gave us the result 5.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So we overrode that normal order of operations

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
by adding parenthesis.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So let's look at another case here.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We'll go and set up another equation.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We'll set up a result3 here.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And for result3, what we'll do is we'll set valA,

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
we'll divide that by valC,

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
then we'll multiply that times valD,

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and then finally add in valB.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That sets up one.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So let's go ahead and copy this now.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And we'll duplicate it,

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
but then we'll modify it a little bit.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So we'll call a result here result4.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We'll use some parenthesis.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So the first thing I'll do is put parenthesis

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
around this addition here,

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
valD and valB,

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and then what I'll do

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
is I'll put another set around valC

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and the result of valD plus valB.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So I've now got nested parenthesis.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So with that in place now,

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
what I want to do is just go ahead

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and print these guys out, as well.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay, we're all set there.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's go ahead and run it.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You'll notice again,

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
we get very different results.

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
For the result3 we get 13.

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
For result4 we get the number 1.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well what's different?

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well again remember that multiplicative operations

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
come ahead of additive,

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and then when two operations are on the same precedence,

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
they're left to right.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So on our result3, the first thing that happens is valA

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
is divided by valC.

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
valA has a value of 21,

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
valC has a value of 3,

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
so that gives us a value of 7.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Then that's multiplied by valD,

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
which has a value of 1,

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
so it's still 7,

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and then we add in valB,

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
which gives us a value of 6.

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And that gives us 13.

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But now in result4,

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
because of the parenthesis,

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
we're changing that order of operations.

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So we have nested parenthesis

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
going to the inner most ones,

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
so first we get valD plus valB.

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So valD is 1, valB is 6,

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
so 1 plus 6 is 7.

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We multiply that times valC, which is 3, which is 21.

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And then we divide valA, which is 21,

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:59:00,000
by 21, giving us the result of 1.
