1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The operators are evaluated in a well-defined order.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If we look at them,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
basically the postfix operators are evaluated first,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
then prefix operators,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
then the multiplicative operations,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
multiplication, division, and modulus,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and then finally the additive operations,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
plus and minus.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Operators of equal precedence are evaluated

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
from the left side of the equation moving right.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And you can override precedence by using parenthesis.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And if you have nested parenthesis,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:59:00,000
those parenthesis are evaluated from the inside out.
