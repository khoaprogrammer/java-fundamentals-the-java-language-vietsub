00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome to this module on Variables, Data Types, and Math Operators.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Jim Wilson.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In this module, we'll first look at how to name and use variables.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We'll then look at the primitive data types in Java and their behavior.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We'll go through the arithmetic operators and the order of precedence.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And then finally, type conversions, both implicit and explicit type conversions.
