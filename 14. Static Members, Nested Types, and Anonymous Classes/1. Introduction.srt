00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to the final module

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
of the Pluralsight Java fundamentals course

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
on the Java language.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this module, we're going to look at static members,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
nested types, and anonymous classes.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My name is Jim Wilson.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So as we go through this module,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
we're going to touch on a number of things.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
First of all, the idea of static members

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
having static methods and fields

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and then we'll look at something called

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
static initialization blocks,

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the ability to do one time type initialization.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Then we'll look at nested types

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and then a very particular type of nested type

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
called inner classes where we actually can have

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the nested classes instance automatically associated

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
with an instance of its enclosing class.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And then finally, we'll talk about anonymous classes.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:59:00,000
The ability to declare and create a class all at one time.
