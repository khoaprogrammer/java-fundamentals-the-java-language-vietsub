00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to the next module of our Java Fundamentals Course

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
on the Java language.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this module, we take a closer look at parameters.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Jim Wilson.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In this module, we'll first look at the idea of parameter

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
immutability, the idea that changes made to a parameter

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
in a method are not reflected once we exit the method.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But members of a class can be affected inside of a method.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then we'll look at the idea of constructor and method

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
overloading, the idea of having a constructor

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
or method with differing parameters.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And then finally the idea of supporting a variable number of parameters.
