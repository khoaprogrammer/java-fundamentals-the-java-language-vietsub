1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The key things you want to remember from this module.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Remember that parameters are immutable.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What that means is that any change made to a parameter

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
within a method are not reflected once you exit that method.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It doesn't matter whether it's a Primitive Type

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
or a reference to a Class.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But you can make changes to members of a class.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Because remember that the parameter's

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
actually pointing off to that object instance.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So those individual members can be changed.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A constructor or method can actually

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
have multiple versions of it.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In other words, you can have differing parameter lists.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We call that Overloading.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Remember though that each one

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
needs to have a unique signature.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That signature is made up of its name, the number

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
of parameters and the type of each parameter.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And finally, remember that methods can be declared

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to accept a varying number of parameter values.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Basically you process it just like it's an array,

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
because it actually is an array.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's just the Java environment is taking care of

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
creating the array instance for you.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The one key restriction is, that can only be done with

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the last parameter received by that method or constructor.
