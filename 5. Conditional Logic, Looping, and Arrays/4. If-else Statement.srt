1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The if else statement allows us to conditionally execute

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
another statement, so rather than just returning a value,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we can execute an actual statement.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Basically we start out with just the keyword if, followed by

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
parenthesis, and inside of those parenthesis, we add our

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
condition and then following that we add the statement we

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
want to execute if that condition is true.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If the condition was false we would just skip over that statement.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
All right so to see that in action, I have some code here

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
where I have two variables.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
v1 is 10, v2 is four.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I say if v2 is greater than v2, print out "v1 is bigger".

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So basically it just evaluates that condition as long as

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
it's true, which in this case it is,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
it prints out "v1 is bigger".

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If statements can optionally have an else clause added

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
to them, which says, "What do you want to do if the

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
"condition is false?"

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So if we put else, followed by whatever you want that

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
action to be on the false side.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So our code here, we're just going to say else, print out

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
"v1 is not bigger".

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oftentimes you'll have more than simply, if this condition

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
is true or it's false.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You may have multiple things you need to evaluate, so you

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
can actually chain if else statements together and when you

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
do that, the system will just keep evaluating them until one is true.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So we set that up with our regular if statement just like we

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
did before, followed by the else, but after the else we can

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
put another if and another condition, and if that condition

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
is true we have it's true statement.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And we can repeat this as many times as we want, all right?

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We can have 20 or 30 of these in a row if we wanted to.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That probably wouldn't be good coding practice but it's

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
completely legal and you can optionally have just an else

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
at the end to say, "Well if none of those were true, what

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
"should I do in that case?"

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So to see that in code, here we have our v1 is 10, v2 is 40.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We say, "Well if v1 is greater than v2,

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
"print out 'v1 is bigger' else if v1 is less than v2,

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
"print out 'v2 is bigger' and if neither of those are true,

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
"then print out 'v1 and v2 are equal'."

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So in this case the system would first evaluate the

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
"is v1 greater than v2?"

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's not so it jumps on to that next condition,

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
"is v1 less than v2?"

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Oh, it is, go ahead and print out "v2 is bigger".
