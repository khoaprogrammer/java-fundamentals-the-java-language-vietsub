00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
A conditional assignment

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
allows us to assign a value to a variable

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
based on the result of some condition.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So if we look at setting up an assignment here.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're actually going to divide things into multiple parts

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
where we have a question mark and a colon.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What that lets us do is have a condition,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and then when we test that condition,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
if the condition is true we return the value

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
immediately after the question mark.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But if the condition is false,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we return the value after the colon.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So let's see that in action.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I have some simple code here

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
where I've got two variables, all right.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
v1 is seven and v2 is five,

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and now I set this up so that

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
my vmax equals v1 greater than v2.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So we're doing that condition.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We test that condition.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Is seven greater than five?

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Since it is, vmax gets back the first value there,

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the v1, which is a seven.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
All right, it's a true value.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Look at another example.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I set this up where I have students as 30

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and rooms as four.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now if I say that students per room equals the condition

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
is rooms equal to zero?

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well if it was true we return zero,

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but if it's false, which it is, we go into the equation

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
of dividing students by rooms.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So the value in students per room is 7.5,

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the result of that equation.
