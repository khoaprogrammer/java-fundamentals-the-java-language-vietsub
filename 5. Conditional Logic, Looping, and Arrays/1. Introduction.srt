00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to the next module in our Java Fundamentals course

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
on the Java language.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In this module, we're going to take a look at

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
conditional logic, looping, and arrays.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name is Jim Wilson.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We've got a jam packed module here.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to talk about a lot of great stuff.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're going to start out looking at the various aspects of

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
conditional logic in Java.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Then we're going to look at the basic looping capabilities.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We'll take a look at arrays,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
something called the for-each loop,

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and then we'll finish up with the switch statement.
