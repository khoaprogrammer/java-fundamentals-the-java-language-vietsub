1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's take a look at a demo where we nest one if statement

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
inside of another.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have a simple program here where we have two variables

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
declared, students, which is set to zero, and rooms.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Next thing we want to do a very simple bit of code.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're going to say if students is greater than zero,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
if that's true, I want to print out the average number of

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
students in each room and then if students is not greater

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
than zero, I just want to get it to print out the fact that

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
there are no students.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay so that's pretty simple, right?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So let's go ahead and run it and when we run it

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we get the message we expect, all right,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
no students prints out, so that code's working well.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now if we look at this code, you know, I realize that,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
you know, I'm dividing students by rooms.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What would happen if rooms was zero?

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well just like in real mathematics, you can't divide by zero

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
well in Java, you can't divide by zero either.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
All right, so if we were really going to be, you know,

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
good defensive programmers here, we would actually

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
check to make sure that rooms was not zero before we

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
actually tried to do this division, all right, so what I'm

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
going to do here is just add a line here that says, "Well,

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
"only do this if rooms is greater than zero."

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So I've got that test in there.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's go ahead and indent this so that it matches up

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
with our style here of indenting underneath the ifs.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's go ahead and run this now.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And you notice that when we run it, we don't see our

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
no students message.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What happened? That worked before, why is it gone now?

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, because the else is matching up to the closest if

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to it, all right, so in this case, the else is matching up

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
to the test for rooms being greater than zero even though

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
we really want it to match up against

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
students greater than zero.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So how do we fix that?

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well we can use the block statement style.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What we can do is take the if here, put an open bracket

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
before it, and then another open bracket here, and now

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that closes up that if block, right?

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So that prevents the else from matching up to the if for

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
rooms; we've closed that if for rooms within a block

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
under the if for students, that way the else matches up

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to the if that we want it to.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right, so if I go ahead and run this now

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:59:00,000
our program now performs correctly, printing out the no students message.
