00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's take a look at a demo comparing the behavior

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
of a logical and to that of a conditional logical and.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We have a simple program here where we have

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
two variables declared at the top,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
students equals 150 and rooms equals zero.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And let's say I just want to put in a condition here

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
where I want to print out the message "crowded"

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
if there are more than 30 students to a room.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So I'm just going to run my if statement.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll just take students, divide that by rooms, and if that's

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
greater than 30 I'll go ahead and I'll print out my message.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So if the result of students divided by rooms

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is greater than 30, I print out that crowded message.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now of course one of the issues I have is that, what if the

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
rooms is zero, right, and you can't legally divide by zero.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So what I really want to say is, "Well, if rooms is greater

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
"than zero AND students divided by rooms is greater

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
"than 30, then I'll print out that message."

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So what I'll do here, is just put in your rooms greater than

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
zero and then and students divided by rooms greater than 30.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
All right, so that way we'll do both tests, right?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Rooms is greater than zero so we have valid division

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and then the result of the division.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So let's go ahead and run this.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And notice what happens there, I'm getting an error message.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Because it's not legal to divide by zero.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because what happened is that it first did rooms

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
greater than zero, now that tested to false, right,

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
because rooms is not greater than zero, but then it

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
tried to do the right hand side of the and as well.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It tried to do the students divided by rooms, which created

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
the error because you can't legally divide by zero.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But now, if I go ahead and change this to the double

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
ampersand, making it the conditional logical and, now

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we'll only do the right hand side if the left hand side

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
was true, or conditionally, right?

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It does the right hand side conditionally.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Now if I run it, I don't get the error message.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It ran successfully.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now it didn't print the message out, right, because the

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
combined value of the test was false.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Rooms was not greater than zero, but we ran successfully.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So we were able to conditionally execute the right hand

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
side of the and based on the left hand side, so if the

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
left hand side had been true, we would have also run the

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
right hand side to see if it was true, but once the left

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
hand side was false, we never even bothered running the

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:59:00,000
right hand side.
