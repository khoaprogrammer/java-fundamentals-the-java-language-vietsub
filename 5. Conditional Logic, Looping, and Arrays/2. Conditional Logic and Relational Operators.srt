1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Adding conditional logic is one of those

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
simple things we do in our programs,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but they're really central to them behaving well.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When we talk about adding conditional logic,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
all we're saying is that our program will behave

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
differently based on differences in data values.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And there are four things we need to understand to do this.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
One is relational operators that give us

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the ability to test different values.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Something called conditional assignments, which allows

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
us to assign values differently based on conditions.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The if statement, which allows us

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to change our code path in our application.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And then logical operators, that allow us

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to combine different conditions together.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Looking first at relational operators.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
These allow us to test values against one another.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
These are very familiar if you are coming from

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
any other programming language.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We'll just go through them quickly.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The first one is greater than.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is the first value larger than the second value?

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Look at an integer example, five is greater than four.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We get into character data values.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What this does is this uses

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the different Unicode code points.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So if the code point is larger, then the

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
comparison is considered larger.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So c is greater than a

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And there's no way to do a greater than with a Boolean.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay, then there's greater than or equal to,

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
which says that if they are the same

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
or the first one is larger.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay, so five is greater than or equal to four

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
but four is also is greater than or equal to four.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Because it's the same.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Our character ones,

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
c is greater than or equal to a

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and a is greater than or equal to a.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Less than, is the first one less than the second one?

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Four is less than five, a is less than c.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Less than or equal.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Four is less than or equal to five

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and four is also less than or equal to four.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now, we get to equal to.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Alright, now equal to is the equivalent,

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
or the value is the same, right?

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We use two equal signs to do that, right?

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So five is equal to five, and c is equal to c.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That makes sense.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When we get to the Boolean,

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
basically, they are equal if both sides are the same.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So, true is equal to true.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So that makes sense.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But also, false is equal to false, right?

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So, if you have two false values compared for equal,

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that resolves to true, because those values are the same.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And then finally, not equal to is simply, are they different?

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Four is not equal to five, a is not equal to c,

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and true is not equal to false.
