1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Since Java is an object-oriented language, we want to use

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
good object-oriented techniques when we build our programs.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Remember that one of the things we talked about is that

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
when you consume an object or when you use an object,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
you want to be able to think about the "what"

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
of what you're doing not the "how" of what you're doing.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Because one important idea in there is that as we build

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
our objects the internal representation of those objects

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
should generally be hidden.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The user of an object shouldn't have to know a whole lot

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
about the way that object is built.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So the idea of hiding this internal representation

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
is an idea we call encapsulation.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In Java, the way we achieve encapsulation is by using

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
access modifiers.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's talk about some of the most basic access modifiers.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now the most basic access modifier at all is to have

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
no access modifier and, in fact, that's what

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we've been doing up until now.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If a class or a class member does not have an access modifier

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
on it that's considered what we call "package private",

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
only usable within its own package.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We'll talk more about that one later in the course

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
when we spend more time on packages.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now one of the ones we commonly see is the public access

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
modifier and if a class or a class member is

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
marked as public, that means it can just be used anywhere,

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
anywhere in the program.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And the last one we're going to talk about for now

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
is one called private.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If a class member is marked as private, it's only accessible

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
from within the class where it's declared.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now top level classes, the kind of classes

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that we're working with right now, cannot use the

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
private access modifier.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Little later in the course we'll talk about some scenarios

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
with nested classes where we can use the private access modifier.
