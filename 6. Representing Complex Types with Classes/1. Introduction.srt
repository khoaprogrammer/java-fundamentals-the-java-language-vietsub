00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to the next module of our

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Java Fundamentals course on the Java language.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this module, we look at how we represent complex types using classes.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name is Jim Wilson.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In this module we start digging into the

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
object-oriented aspects of Java.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we'll first look at classes, how we create them

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and how we use them.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We'll then look at the concept of classes

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
being reference types and how that makes them

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
behave differently than primitive types.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We'll look at the idea of encapsulation, other words,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
how do we keep the details of our classes inside of our

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
classes and not the concern of those using the classes.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We'll look at the basic behavior and creation of methods in Java.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And then we'll look at how we control interaction

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:59:00,000
with the data in our classes using field accessors and mutators.
