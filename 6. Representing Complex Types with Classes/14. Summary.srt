00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this module, we started introducing the object-oriented aspects of Java.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That means that we started talking about classes

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
because classes are the way we describe our object.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There's a template for creating an object.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That we use the class keyword to declare them,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we use the new keyword to create instances of them.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Remember that classes create reference types,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
meaning that if we have a variable that's a type of a class,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the variable doesn't actually hold the class instance

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
itself, it holds a reference to the class instance.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's really important because when we assign between

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
two variables, we don't copy the object,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we copy the reference causing the two variables

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to point to the same object instance.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Really important difference from primitive types.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Encapsulation is an important part

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
of object-oriented programming, we don't want to have

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
our details exposed to the users of our objects.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We use access modifiers to control encapsulation.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We use methods to manipulate the state

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and perform operations on our objects.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If we want to exit a method early or if our method

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
has a return type we use the return keyword to control that.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And objects have not just operations

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but they also have state where we use fields to store

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the object state.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Fields are generally considered a kind of low level detail

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
of our objects, so we generally don't want to expose

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
those directly to users of the objects.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So we normally do or at least most commonly do

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
is use accessors and mutators to control interaction

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
with our fields.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Basically we use methods so that if we can change

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the implementation detail of the data without affecting

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the usage of our class.
