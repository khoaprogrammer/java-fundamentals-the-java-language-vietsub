1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this demo we'll add accessors and mutators to our CalcEngine app.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And we'll look at how to deal with situations

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
where we may want to provide the ability to see a value

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but not modify a value.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So here we are back in our CalcEngine app

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and I'm here in the Mathequation class.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have our four fields at the top,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
they're all currently public.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now the first thing we want to do is go ahead

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and make these guys all private.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So if the value's all private now we can go ahead

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and add our accessors and our mutators.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This can really be straightforward.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's go ahead, let's first do it for leftVal,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so for leftVal go ahead and make it public.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Return value will be the same as leftVal which is double.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We'll call it getLeftVal and all that does

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
is simply return back leftVal.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So that gives us an access of our leftVal.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
For our mutator, again will be public.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This time it will be void though because mutators

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
don't return a value.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It will be set leftVal and we'll accept a parameter

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of type double we'll call leftVal.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And then from there we simply assign a parameter

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to our field.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's pretty straightforward and we're going to do that

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
for rightVal and opCode as well.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So those accessors and mutators in place we can set

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
the values of any of those as well as access them.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And that makes sense for leftVal, rightVal, and opCode.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But result's a little different.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Result is the result of this class doing what it does,

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
executing an operation.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So it doesn't really make sense for anyone to be able

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to modify result from the outside.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They certainly should be able to see it but not modify it.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So this the case where we may want to have a accessor

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
but not a mutator.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What it does is an effect make our result a read-only value.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So we'll do is for our result, we'll go ahead and create

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that accessor but we're not going to have a mutator.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So with that we can now just go ahead and update

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
our application and go ahead and use

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the accessors and mutators we've created.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So down here we create MathEquation instance.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We'll just update this to use the mutator,

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
so I'll say setLeftVal, let me pass the leftVal

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
as a parameter, close this parenthesis.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Do the same thing for rightVal and opCode.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So that now creates the instance of the MathEquation

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
setting each of the values.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then we head up here where we access the result,

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
we'll change that to use the accessor for results.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's make this getResult.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So let's go ahead and run it, make sure everything works.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And there we have our output values.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So we've now updated our MathEquation class.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So we're properly hiding the data inside of it,

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
which will allow us to evolve it when effectively over time

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:59:00,000
without impacting code that uses our class.
