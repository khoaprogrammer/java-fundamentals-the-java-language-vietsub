00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is a great time for us to just take a minute and look

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
at the rules and conventions for creating class names.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now class names have the same rules as variable names

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in terms of what characters are allowed.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And they actually even follow most of the same conventions.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They still use only letters and numbers,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the first character is always a letter,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but one of the key differences in conventions is they

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
follow a naming pattern called Pascal Case which says that

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the first letter of every word including the first word

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
is upper case with all the rest being lower case.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So if we have a class name like BankAccount,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
both the B in bank and the A in account

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
are both capital.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And if that was a variable name,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the B would have been lower case.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What we want to do is that when we're naming

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
our classes, we want to use descriptive nouns.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So we want to say things like a class called Person.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Or class TrainingVideo.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In general, we want to avoid abbreviations.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We want to use full words.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now the caveat to that would be any scenario where

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the abbreviation tends to be more widely used

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
than the word itself.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Like, people rarely say "Uniform Resource Locator".

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Using "URL" is much more common.
