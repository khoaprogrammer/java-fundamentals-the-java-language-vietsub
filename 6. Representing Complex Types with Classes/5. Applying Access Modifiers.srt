1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's take a look at how the access modifiers affect

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the uses of our class and its class members.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now I have here basically the same class

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we looked at earlier.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We have our class Flight, it has some fields declared

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
at the top, passengers and seats.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It has a constructor.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It then has a method add1Passenger and I've also added

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
another method to this called handleTooMany

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that gets called from add1Passenger.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The idea being that when we call out 1Passenger

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
if there's not enough seats add1Passenger

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
will call handleTooMany to do whatever we want

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to have happen when have too many passengers.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So now let's take this and we'll go ahead and add

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
a public access modifier to class Flight.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now what that means, of course, is that we're now

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
allowed to access class Flight from anywhere.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So we can go out there and declare our variable

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
called flight1 of type Flight.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to go ahead and mark the constructor as

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
public as well which means I'm also allowed to now

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
create instances of this class.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We'll talk more about constructors shortly but the key

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
thing here is that we are allowed to create instances

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
of the Flight class.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now let's take our two fields, passengers and seats,

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and we'll mark those as private.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now as private they're accessible from within the class.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So inside of our constructor we're allowed to access them.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Inside that method add1Passenger we're allowed

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
to access them, that's fine.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But if from outside the class, we tried to do something

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
like we did earlier like print out the value of passengers,

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that's no longer allowed.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That would actually be a compile time error.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We wouldn't be allowed to have that code in our

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
program accessing it from outside of the class.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now looking at our methods, let's say we mark

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
add1Passenger as public and handleTooMany as private.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, from outside the class I'm free to call add1Passenger.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That calls into add1Passenger.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Add1Passenger if it checks the number of seats,

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
if they're already full it actually would call down to

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
handleTooMany and that would be just fine because

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
we're accessing the handleTooMany from with the inside

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
of our Flight class.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But if from the outside we tried to call handleTooMany,

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
again, that would be a compile time error.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We're not allowed to access it from outside of the class.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now one thing to note, now that our class is marked

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
as public, remember that earlier I mentioned that the class

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
file for class normally has the same name as the class.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well once we mark this class as public, that becomes

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
a requirement; public classes have to be inside

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
of a source file with the same name.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So a public class called Flight has to be in a source file

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
called Flight.java.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now if it's not marked as public, that requirement is not in place.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Are you allowed to name the file whatever you want.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You always want to be careful about choosing the name

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the class file something different than the class.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There are legitimate reasons to do so.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:59:00,000
But just consider that carefully.
