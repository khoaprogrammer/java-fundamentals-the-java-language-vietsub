00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to the next module of the Pluralsight

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Java Fundamentals course in the Java language.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this module, we're going to take a look

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
at creating abstract relationships with interfaces.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Jim Wilson.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Throughout this module, we'll look

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
at a number of issues related to interfaces.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We'll start by just defining what an interface is.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll then look at implementing an interface,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and we'll do that by taking a look

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
at some of the interfaces that are provided by Java.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll then look at how we can have a single class

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that implements multiple interfaces.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We'll then take a look at declaring our own interface.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We will do that by adding some features

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to our calc engine app that we've been working

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:59:00,000
on throughout the course.
