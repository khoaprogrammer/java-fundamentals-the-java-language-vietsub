1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To wrap up, remember the key things

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
you want to remember from this module

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is that an interface defines a contract.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It does not provide any sort of implementation,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
all right, it's simply the contract.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That contract can consist of methods and constants.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So the way interfaces are implemented are by classes.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Right, classes implement interfaces,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and what that means is

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that any class that implements the interface

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
conforms to the contract defined by the interface,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
right, and that allows us to have classes

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
with very different features and capabilities

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but then can conform at times when they need to

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to specific contracts.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
One of the key things is that,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
whereas a class can only extend one class,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
a class is free to implement as many

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
interfaces as it needs to, so it can conform

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
to as many contracts as it needs to.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And remember that interfaces can also extend one another,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
so you can define an interface

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that extends another interface.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And remember that whenever you implement

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
an interface that extends another interface,

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
by implementing the extended interface,

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:59:00,000
you implicitly implement the base interface.
