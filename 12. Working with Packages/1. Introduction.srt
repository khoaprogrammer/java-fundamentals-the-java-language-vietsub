00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to the next module,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
in the Pluralsight Java Fundamentals course

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in the Java language.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this module, we're going to cover working with packages.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Jim Wilson.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So as we go through this module,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the first thing we'll look at is

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
what exactly is a package in Java.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We'll look at a lot of capabilities of packages

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the benefits they provide,

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
such as packages acting as a name space.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What does it mean to import a package?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
How do we use packages to limit access to content?

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So we can have types and capabilities

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that are visible inside of a package

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but not outside of a package

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and then this idea of distributing packages

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and working with Java Archive Files

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:59:00,000
or otherwise known as JAR files.
