00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Packages are an important concept in Java

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but they're actually a pretty simple concept.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Basically a package is just a group of related types.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But by putting our types in packages,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we get kind of three core benefits.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
One, packages create a name space

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They provide a way for us to avoid type naming collisions.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
To provide an access boundary.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They provide a way for us to limit access to types

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and types members and also,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
they act as a way for us to distribute our types.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now we'll look at each one of these ideas in detail

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
throughout this module but first,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
let's take a look at the idea of how we declare packages.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now each source file identifies the associated package.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We do that by using the package keyword.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The package declaration and a source file

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
must appear before any type declarations.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If we take a look at our idea of our flight class here

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that we've been using throughout the course.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
To put that into a packet,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
we simply added the keyword package

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and then the name of that package.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In this case, XXXXXX.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Once that package declaration's in the source file,

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
any types that appear within that source file

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
will now be part of that package.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now obviously, a package name like XXXXXX

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is not going to be very useful

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
in terms of dealing with naming collisions and so forth.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So in this next clip, let's take a look

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
at this idea of packages being useful as a name space
