00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Some of the key things we want to remember from this module.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Keep in mind that we want to make sure

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that our objects are always created initially

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
in some useful state, we don't want to allow the user

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to open an object and have it in an erroneous state.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They might not be able to do something meaningful with it,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but it should at least not be error-based

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
when they first create it.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In terms of how we can initialize our objects,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we saw there is a number of ways, the simplest way

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
is field initializers that allow us to just associate

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
a value with a field as part of its declaration.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
As we associate code with our object creation,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
then we have constructors, and every class

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
has at least one constructor.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If we don't provide a constructor, Java will provide one

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that has no arguments on it.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We can provide multiple constructors, and remember that

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
once we provide one constructor, we're now responsible

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
to provide all of them.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If we provide a constructor that has arguments,

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
if we still want to allow people to create

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
an instance of our object using constructor

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
with no arguments, we then have to provide

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that constructor as well.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We can chain our constructors together which allows us

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to unify coding constructors so that we can pass

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
parameters from one constructor back to another

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
constructor to use that code.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Remember that when we do chain constructors together,

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the call from one constructor to another has to be the

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
first line of that constructor.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
To have code which gets executed no matter

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which constructor is called, we have initialization blocks.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Remember that syntax in that is kind of weird,

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
it's just a set of brackets with code inside of it,

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
not part of any constructor or method.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Given all these different ways to initialize our objects

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and get them constructed up, we want to make sure

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
we always keep the order in mind.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Remember that field initializers are first,

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
then initialization blocks

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and then finally, our constructors.
