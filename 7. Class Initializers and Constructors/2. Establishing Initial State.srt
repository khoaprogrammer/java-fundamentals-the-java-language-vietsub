1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Remember that we talked about the fact that classes

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
are made up of both state and executable code.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's reasonable to expect that when

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
an object is first created, that it's going to be in some useful state.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Java will provide a default state

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
when the object is first created, but that might sometimes not be enough.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You may need to actually set these values yourself

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
or even execute some code.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Java gives the ability to set the initial state

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
of an object and it provides three separate mechanisms

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
for doing so.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
One is what they call Field initializers, where we assign

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
a specific value to a field.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Another is called Constructors where we can potentially

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
pass in parameters and run code to set the state.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Another one is called Initialization blocks

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that allows us to run code that can be shared potentially

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
across constructors.
