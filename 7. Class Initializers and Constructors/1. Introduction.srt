00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to the next module in our Java Fundamentals Course

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
on the Java language.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this module, we're going to look at class initializers

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and constructors, my name is Jim Wilson.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In this module, we're going to first look at

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the idea of establishing the initial state of our objects.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We'll look at how we can set the value of class fields

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
as part of the class declarations.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We touched on constructors in the last module,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
we'll look a lot more at how we work with constructors

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and the idea of having multiple constructors.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We'll then look at how we can chain multiple constructors

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
together and even use constructor visibility

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to control how and where our class instances are created.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We'll talk about a way to share code across constructors

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
called initialization blocks.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And with all these different ways to construct

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and initialize our objects, we'll talk about how the order

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:59:00,000
of those things occur.
