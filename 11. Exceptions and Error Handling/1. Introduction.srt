2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
fundamentals course, on the Java language.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000

My name is Jim Wilson.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this module, we cover a number of things

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
related to exceptions.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We'll first take a look at the role of exceptions.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Then, we'll talk about the try/catch/finally statement,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that allows us to handle exceptions.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We'll talk about our responsibilities when we have

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
exceptions that cross method boundaries, look at how

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to throw exceptions, and finally, how to create our own custom exception types.
