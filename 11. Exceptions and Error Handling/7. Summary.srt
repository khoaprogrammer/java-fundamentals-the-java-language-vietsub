00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To wrap up, remember our focus in this module

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is on exceptions.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And exceptions provides an non-intrusive way

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to signal errors.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And, when we're working with exceptions, we use try, catch

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and finally to provide a structured way

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to handle those exceptions.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The try block is the work we want to perform normally,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the catch block is what we want to do

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
if something goes wrong, and finally gives us a common place

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to put our clean-up code.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And remember that exceptions are typed, and can be caught

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
by type, so you can have a separate catch statement

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
for differing exception types.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, you can provide a very specific handling for each type.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Remember, though, you want to catch from most specific type

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to least specific, because the system checks from the top

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
down of catches, and the first catch it encounters

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
they can assign that exception type to it will use.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, if you've got a more specific handler, you want to

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
put that before your more general handler.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Remember, exceptions are raised using the throw key word,

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
but remember that, if a method has any checked exceptions

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that it doesn't catch, then it must declare those exceptions

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
can occur by using the throws clause

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
on the method declaration.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And normally, when we throw exceptions,

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
we want to choose one of the build-in exceptions, but,

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
if we need to, we can create our own custom exception types.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And normally, those exception types will inherit

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
from the exception class, which makes our custom exceptions

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:59:00,000
checked exceptions.
