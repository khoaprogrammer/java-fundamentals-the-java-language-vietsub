00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to the next module of the Pluralsight

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Java Fundamentals course on the Java Language.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this module we discuss class inheritance.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name is Jim Wilson.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have a lot of great content to talk about in this module.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
First we'll take a look at the basics of

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
class inheritance in Java.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The idea of member hiding and member overriding.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The object class, the base class of all classes in Java.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Object equality, what happens when you compare two objects

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to see if they're equal. And what does equal actually mean?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We'll look at the super keyword, a useful tool for accessing

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
base class behaviors in a derived class.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We'll look at how to control class inheritance

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and member overriding behavior using final and abstract.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then finally we'll look at how constructors work

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:59:00,000
when inheriting one class from another.
