00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to the next module

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
of the Pluralsight Java fundamentals course

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
on the Java language.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this module, we talk more about data types.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Jim Wilson.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
As we go through this module,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we'll first look at the String class

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and how to work with string values.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We'll then look at how we can work with strings

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and manipulate strings more efficiently

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
using the StringBuilder class.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We'll see how we can bring the capability of classes

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to primitive values, using the primitive wrapper classes.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We'll see how to create fields

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that can't be changed once set, using final fields.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Then we'll finish up with enumeration types,

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which allow us to define types

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that can only hold a finite list of values.
