1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Java, like most programming languages,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
has the ability to include comments, all right?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And, comments are basically text inside of your

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
source code that the compiler doesn't see.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
All right, and there are really kind of just

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
two general uses for comments.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
One is that it allows you to add human-readable notes

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to your source code.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It allows you to type things in the source code,

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so that when you look at it later or someone else

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
looks at it, you're just leaving notes

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to understand what you were doing there.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's also useful for hiding source code without deleting it.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Maybe you're testing things out, so you want to just

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
kind of take some things away and type some new stuff,

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or there's something you don't want to do anymore,

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but you think you might want to do it again in the future.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, comments allow you to take that stuff out so that

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the contents in your source code, but the compiler

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
doesn't compile it.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There are three types of comments in Java.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
One, which is called line comments.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If you basically put a double slash,

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
basically the compiler ignores everything

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
until the end of the line.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And, when I say by the end of the line,

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
it's actually until you hit the Enter key,

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the new line character.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's not like other statements where it relies

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
on the semicolon, all right.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So, the compiler just skips everything

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
until the next new line.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
(mumbles) called block comments,

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
where you use a slash, star to begin the comment,

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and a star, slash to end it.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, compiler skips everything between those notations.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They can be, happen in the middle of a line,

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
or they can span multiple lines.

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And the last kind is a special kind of comment

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
called a JavaDoc comment,

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
which starts out slash, star, star,

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and it ends star, slash.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There's a utility called JavaDoc

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that allows you to generate documentation

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
using this special comment format.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That allows you basically to write your code

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
documentation right inside of your source code.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And then, when you run the JavaDoc utility,

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
if you follow the appropriate structure in your comments,

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that utility will generate documentation

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
right from the source code file.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The details of JavaDoc are outside the scope

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
of this course, but I've got that URL

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
up there on the screen for you if you want

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to dig into JavaDoc and learn more about it.
