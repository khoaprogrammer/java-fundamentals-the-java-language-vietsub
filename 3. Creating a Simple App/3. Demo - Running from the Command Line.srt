1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's walk through a demo now of running

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
our program from the command line.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In other words, what we want to do is

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
look at how we can run our program

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
without having to use a developer tool

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
like IntelliJ to do it.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In the previous demo, we when we wrote our application,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
where we did all of the work here

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
inside of a developer tool, in this case, IntelliJ.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All right, and as did our compile.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And, even that ran it for us.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now as developers, we have that tool.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But, how end-users run our program,

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
or how does an end-user execute the program

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
without having one of these developer tools?

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And, that's what we want to look at now.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, the thing we want to remember is that

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the Main Class for our application here is called Main.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
All right, it didn't have to be,

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but that's what it's called here.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And, we're going to have to remember that

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
when it becomes time to run our program.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, remember that we say that end-users

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
have to install the JRE, right,

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the Java Runtime Environment.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And, let's take a look in there for a second.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Here I am on the C Drive of my Windows computer.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And what I'm going to do is go down to here

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to Program Files, and inside, there's a folder

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
called Java, right?

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And inside there, that's the JRE, all right?

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's the execution file, right?

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Java Runtime Environment.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And, we said that that's what actually runs

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
our programs, right?

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Java programs don't run directly.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They run within the Java environment.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If I go inside of this folder, you see there's

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
another folder called Bin.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And, you'll notice inside of here,

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
if I scroll down a little bit, there's actually

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
a program called Java.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That Java program is what actually runs our program.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All right, now if you're on Linux or Mac,

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
you can basically use that Java program directly.

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If you're on Windows, you want to make sure

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
that it's actually in your Path, right, so that you can

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
actually type just the word Java, and it will

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
find it in this folder.

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, what we want to do is keep track of this location

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
where we found the Java exe.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So, we're going to just copy this.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And again, what we want to do is put that

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
into the Path of our machine.

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, what I've got up here is Control Panels.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So, I'm going to go ahead and open up the Control Panel.

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
In your Control Panel, I'm going to find the System entry.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Open that guy up.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And, what I want to do is go to Advance System Settings.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And from here, I want to go to Environment Variables.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And, what I want to do here is I want to

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
go ahead and add that to my Path, right?

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So, I'm going to add it to my User Path.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now, I happen to have no current User Path set up.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
On your machine, you may already have

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
an entry in here that says Path.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If you have an existing one, you're going to

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
highlight it and say, Edit.

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I want to create a new one,

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
because I don't have Path yet.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So, I want to call it Path.

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And, all I'm going to do is paste in that location

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
where that Java exe was, all right?

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And when I say OK, now we see Path listed here.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
All right, and so just kind of to clarify it,

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
if when you open Environment Variables,

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
if you already saw Path, you would highlight it and click Edit.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Because I didn't have it already, I had clicked New.

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All right, and so we're going to say OK.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And, OK.

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And, close these guys up.

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And so now, I have the folder where my Java program's

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
located in my Path, so I can just type it

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
from the command line.

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So, now what we want to do is run our program.

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So, what I'm going to do now is go to the folder

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
where I created our application's project.

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So, when I create our application's project,

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I created it in this Demo folder.

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And, remember I called it Project Hello World.

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So, I go in here into Hello World.

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You see a series of folders.

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now, the exact layout of these folders is specific

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
to the way IntelliJ does it.

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But in any environment your using,

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
you're going to see something similar to this.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So, what we want to do here is go to our Out folder.

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Alright, again, the name Out is specific to IntelliJ.

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Whatever tool you're using will have something like that.

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And so, we go to Out.

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And you'll see Production, is another folder inside there.

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And then, inside of here, we see Hello World.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
All right, if I go inside of there, we can see,

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
in this case our Class file.

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This Hello World folder under Out and Production

106
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
is the result of compiling our program.

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And again, the names Out and Production

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
are specific to IntelliJ.

109
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But, whatever environment you're working

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
from, you'll have some folder structure like that.

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The key is we want to have wherever the output

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
was placed, which is our Hello World.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All right, now that we're here,

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
we can actually open up a command line

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and run our program.

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, what I'm going to do is,

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
let's go ahead and jump up here.

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Just type CMD to open up a command prompt

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
in this location.

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So, I've got a command prompt here.

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And, what I'm going to do is just type,

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Java hyphen version.

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I mean, there's there it outputs that it's

124
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
the, it gives me, the version number of Java.

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And, basically what this really tells me is

126
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
that my Java command's working.

127
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If that doesn't work for you, if you get something

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
like command not found or you get a version

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
different than the one you were expecting,

130
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
what you may have to do is just log out and log

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
back in because user level Environment Variables

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
don't take effect right away.

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
All right, so if you get, again,

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
if you get like program not found when you type Java,

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
just log out and log back in.

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It should then work when you open your

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
next command prompt.

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If it doesn't, just go back and make sure you've

139
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
got your Path Setting to the right location

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
to where that Java dot exe was located.

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So now to run our program, what we're going to do

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
is say, Java, and what we want to do

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
is give it the Class name that actually had

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
that Main entry point in it.

145
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Remember, in our case, our Class name

146
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
was actually Main.

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So, let's go ahead and hit Enter.

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And, there we see Hello World again.

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All right, so we see that we actually successfully

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
ran our program without having to use any fancy IDE.

151
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
All right, this is how it would run

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
in an end-user environment.

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They would have your Class file,

154
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the thing we produced when we built the program,

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and just using the Java command, goes ahead and launches it.
