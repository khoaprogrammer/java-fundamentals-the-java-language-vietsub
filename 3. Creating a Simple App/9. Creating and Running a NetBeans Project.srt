1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Up to now, we've done all of our IDE work inside of IntelliJ.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So, let's take a quick look at using NetBeans

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to create and run a project.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I have a shortcut to NetBeans right here

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
on my Desktop, so let's go ahead and start that up.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, here we are inside of the NetBeans IDE.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, let's create a new project.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, I'm just going to say File, New Project.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And when you come over here, it just asks me

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
what kind of project I want it to be.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, I want it to go ahead and be a Java project.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's going to be a Java application, so that's all fine.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, just click Next.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So now, it comes in here and it

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
first wants the project name.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, we'll go ahead and call this.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We'll just call this our

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello NetBeans project.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And so just like IntelliJ, the project name

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is really an IDE concept, all right.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So, what we want to do now is go through it,

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
identify where we want it to go,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
so I'm just going to put it in the same

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Demo folder I've been using for the other parts,

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
for the other demos.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And, I'm down here to create a Main Class, all right.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, remember that we have our Main entry point

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
into our application.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now in NetBeans, you actually specify the package name

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and the Class name all together, all right.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And so, we're going to follow the same rules

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
of com dot Pluralsight.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So, I've the top level of the package name.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm just going to make the next level, just say Example.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And so at this point, that's still my package name.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And then, we'd give it that initial Class.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And, remember we said although IntelliJ

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
always called it Main, we can call it anything we want.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, I'm going to go ahead and call it App Main.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So, what this is really saying is that my initial Class

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
is called App Main and it's in the package

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
com dot Pluralsight dot Example.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, let's click finish.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, here we are inside of the source code.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I went ahead and closed this output window for now.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Just to get it out of the way, so we can see more.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So, notice that over there on the left,

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
there's our source packages and that's our

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
App Main dot Java, which is the source code file

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
we're in right now.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Notice there at the top, it creates our package declaration,

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
com dot Pluralsight dot Example,

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and we see our Class definition.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We've got our Main entry point, which is the public

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
static void Main, right?

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So, that's where our code will run from initially.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And, you notice also that NetBeans even puts

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
some initial comments in.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
All right, if it's a block comment up at the very top there,

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
it's just telling us a little bit about working

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
with the IDE itself.

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If you notice there's the slash, star, star

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
above the App Main, all right.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's actually a JavaDocs comment.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So, it's even initially laying it out so that we have

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
JavaDocs in place for the App Main,

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and even for our Main entry point.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So, let's go inside of here, and let's just add

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
a little code to output something.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, we've added the code now just to print

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
out, Hello NetBeans.

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So, let's go up here and try running it.

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So, I'm going to go up here to my Run menu,

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
choose Run Project.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So, we can see that Output window,

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that we've got the Hello NetBeans printed out,

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
so we were able to run.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Or, I should say compile and run

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
our application that easily, right?

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Very much like what we did in IntelliJ.

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We saw that there were some basic differences

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
in terms of how we created that initial Class name

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and created the project, but fundamentally,

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
all the IDEs work in very similar ways.

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And now, let's take a look at if we wanted to actually

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
run this application from the command line,

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
where we would actually find the folder,

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
so that we could actually run it.

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
All right, because remember I mentioned earlier

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
that each of the IDEs kind of sets up its output

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
folder structure a little bit differently.

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, here I am in my Demo folder,

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and here's our Hello NetBeans folder

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
that we created for this project.

95
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go down inside of there.

96
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And, you'll notice here that

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
in NetBeans, instead of having an output folder,

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
we actually have this Build folder.

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So, let's go in there,

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and then, there's a Classes folder.

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
All right, an that's where we're going to run

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
our application from in the command line

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
here in a NetBeans project.

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So, we're going to go ahead and just open

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
up the command prompt.

106
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And just like before, we're going to say,

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Java to run it, and we're going to, again,

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
give the package.

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Call it, excuse me, package qualified Class name.

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, com dot Pluralsight dot Example.

111
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All right, and then our Class name,

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
which in this case, we call it App Main.

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If we hit Enter, we can there see our output,

114
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hello NetBeans.

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All right, and so we've still ran it exactly the same.

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The only difference was that the IDE for NetBeans

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
created a slightly different output file structure

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
than IntelliJ had.
