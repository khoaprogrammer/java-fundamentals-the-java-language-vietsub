1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's go ahead now and create our very first Java project.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And, we'll go ahead and just use

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the IntelliJ IDE to do this one.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I have a shortcut to IntelliJ on my Desktop,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so let's go ahead and double-click that guy to start up.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So once IntelliJ starts up here, okay,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
it takes you to this initial window,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and what I want to do is create a new project.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, I'll click on that.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now, it takes me into the Wizard to create the project.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now, one of the first things we have to do

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is, of course, choose we want to have a Java project,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
because we were, IntelliJ worked for a variety of things.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And, we also have to associate the JDK version

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we want to use.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now, you only have to do this step once.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What we do here is where it says Project SDK,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and you'll notice that there are none now.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There's none to choose, all right.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, what we're going to do is click on this New

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
button here on the right,

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
we're going to choose to set up a project in SDK,

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
which is the JDK,

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and what we're going to do now is navigate to

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
where we installed the JDK.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
All right, it's for me, it's on Program Files,

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
scroll down, Java,

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and then, make sure you choose JDK, not the JRE.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
All right, you want the JDK, say OK.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And now that we've done that,

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
we can create projects with that JDK.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So now, one thing that's just a little bit of a challenge

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
is that this Wizard screen doesn't render well

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
on the resolution that we record at.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So, I'm just going to pull that up here just a little bit.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Notice that, the buttons across the bottom.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
All right, so what I'm going to do is click

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the Next button to move onto the next step of the Wizard.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So, I click on the Next button.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So now, it says what template do you want to use,

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
or do you want to use a template at all?

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're going to say, yeah, go ahead

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and create it from a template.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And what that does is just creates

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
some initial file layouts for us.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Sets things up, so we can go ahead and get started easily.

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And, we're just going to create a regular command line

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
application, which is just the most basic kind

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
of Java application, okay?

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If I pull this dialog up, okay,

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm going to click that Next button

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
down there at the bottom.

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So now, we go ahead and want to name things.

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, kind of in the lifelong tradition

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
of programming and programming courses,

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
we're going to create a Hello World app.

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's just go ahead and call this project name Hello World.

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, I've named the project Hello World.

59
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm going to go ahead here and where it says,

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Base Package, I'm going to go ahead

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and delete that away for now.

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We'll come back to that a little bit later.

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And, I'm just specifying where I want it to go.

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So, I was going to put it into a folder

65
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
under my Demo folder for this module,

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
called Hello World.

67
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If I pull this guy up,

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
notice down at that bottom, now there's actually a Finish

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
button, so that's what I'm going to select this time

70
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
is the Finish button.

71
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So as it starts up, it brings me into the project.

72
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
One of the features of IntelliJ is it actually has

73
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
kind of the Tip of the Day.

74
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Just kind of show you different fact about working

75
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
in their environment, and so forth.

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm going to close that up.

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You notice here it's generated a source code file for me.

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And up on the left here, I've got my Project Explorer.

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It just kind of shows me the hierarchy

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
of the files it's created.

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If I expand Hello World in this Source folder here,

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
there's the Main, and that's the Class file

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
that goes with the Class I've created.

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm going to talk a whole bunch more about Classes

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
later in the course.

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is basically just becomes the start of our application.

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now, IntelliJ always creates this initial Class

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
as Class Name Main.

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That Class Name doesn't actually matter.

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We'll talk a lot more about Class names a little bit later.

91
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What does matter is inside of your, there's what's called

92
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
a Method, right?

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's where our code runs.

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And for Java applications, the startup of your application

95
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
must be in a Class that has a member called Main,

96
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
that looks just like this.

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, it has to be public.

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I mean, just publically accessible.

99
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We'll talk more about that modifier later.

100
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The modifier's static, void.

101
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It has to be called Main and it has to look just like this.

102
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So whenever you run your code in Java,

103
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
it's going to look for this as an entry point.

104
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
All right, so what I'm going to do is delete

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
this line away here,

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and we'll do the classic Hello World application.

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So, I'm going to use an object here,

108
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
which I've called System.

109
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And, I'm going to use something called Out and Print Line.

110
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
All right, and this is just a mechanism in Java

111
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we use to print things out to the console.

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Then, we're going to say, Hello World.

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So, we have that there.

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So, this is kind of the most fundamental application

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
we can build, all right?

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Now, the way we run this in IntelliJ is that we go

117
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
up here to the Run menu, click on that,

118
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and we choose Run.

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
When we do that, we'll see that IntelliJ

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
will go ahead and compile our code for us,

121
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and then, down here at the bottom, it shows

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
a Console window, and actually shows

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
the output of our application.

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So in this case, it says, Hello World.

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Now, our focus here is on Java,

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
not on the development environment.

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But, just to show you a couple things

128
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
that makes it easier.

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We saw how to run it from the menu.

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Once we have this window down here,

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
if say, we want to change something,

132
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
(mumbles) say, Hello World,

133
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we'll just say again.

134
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If I want to go ahead and rerun the code, I can go

135
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
down here on the bottom where I have this

136
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
little green arrow, click on that.

137
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And, we'll just run the code over again.

138
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Compile it and run it for us.

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And now, we see Hello World again.

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So, we've successfully run our very first Java

141
00:04:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Hello World program.
