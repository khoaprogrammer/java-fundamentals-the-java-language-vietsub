1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's take a look now at how packages

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
affect our application.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, here we are in IntelliJ.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's go ahead and create a new project.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It'll, of course, be a Java project.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Again, remember that the buttons

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
at the bottom are off the screen here

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
at this resolution.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, we'll go ahead and click that Next button,

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
just accept the defaults here.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going to go ahead and create the project template

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
as a command line.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, I'll go down here and click the Next button.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So now, I'm going to create my project.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
My project name is going to be Organized.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We'll name that as the project.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But now, I'm going to go ahead and give this one a package name.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All right, so we're going to follow

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the rules we talked about.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Com dot Pluralsight.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And then, I'm going to go ahead

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and add our file qualifier.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And, let's just call this one Get Organized.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So now, our project name Organized

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
is a IDE concept, or it's just what we're calling

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the project in the IDE.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But, this package name,

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
com dot Pluralsight dot Get Organized

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
is the package name we're using

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
within a Java sense.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And very often, the packaged,

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the last part of the package name is

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the same as your project name.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But, I just wanted to make them different

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
in this case to show that they're not directly related.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, let's just go ahead and finish this.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So, here we are in our application now.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
All right, we got our source code,

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or excuse me, our Class in place,

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
just like we did before, but now we have

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that package declaration at the top.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
All right, what I want to do here is

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
go ahead and delete this line away,

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and let's go ahead and write some output.

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But this time, we'll just say something like,

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
hello, get organized.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
All right, let's just go ahead and run this, make sure everything's fine.

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, we'll run it just like we did it before.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Run, Run.

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And, we see there in our output,

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
that our Console window shows,

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
hello, get organized.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So, everything run, just like it did before,

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
except within the IDE, nothing's really any different.

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's take a look now about how that change

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to a package affected our source code file hierarchy.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So, I create a project called Organized.

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, this is the folder I created it in.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So, it's inside of there.

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Our SRC, our source code area.

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But, now notice that we have

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
a com Pluralsight,

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and then, a Get Organized.

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
All right, as so that's where our Main dot Java is.

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So, it created our folder just like we thought it would.

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But, let's see how it affects our Class name now.

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So, I'm going to go back up here to the Organize level.

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm going to the output folder, so Out,

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Production, and then, Organized.

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, I'll go in there.

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's go ahead and open up a command line here.

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Now, you notice right away that

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
you don't see the Main dot Java in there.

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In fact, the Main dot Java is actually buried

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
down again under this com folder structure.

76
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But, I don't want to focus on that.

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We'll talk about that aspect of it later in the course.

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But, what I want to do now is open

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
up the command prompt right there.

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So, we've got our command prompt,

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and we're going to go ahead and run the program.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now, remember when we said we run our programs,

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
we (mumbles) identify the Class name.

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
All right, so I'm going to say Java,

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
because we run a Java program.

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm going to say, com dot Pluralsight dot Get Organized.

87
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All right, that's our package name dot Main.

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So now when I run that,

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
we get our hello, get organized.

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because remember that we said by putting it

91
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
in the package, our Class Main, real name is

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
now the fully qualified name within the package.

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Com dot Pluralsight dot Get Organized dot Main.

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So, by running that Class name,

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
qualified with the package,

96
00:03:25,000 --> 00:59:00,000
our application ran correctly.
