1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's take a quick look now at using

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
comments in our code.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here I am back in the program we wrote earlier.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And, let's just take this line we write out

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello World again, let's copy that

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and put it back in a couple more times.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's just say Hello World one, two, and three.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, if we go to run our program down here,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we'll see that all three of those lines get written

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
out for Hello World one, two, and three.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, using comments, we can add information

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
into our source code.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
First, I'll use a line comment,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so I'll just do a Slash, Slash.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll say, this is a comment.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And, this comment only exists until I get to the new line.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
All right, you notice that even the IDE is using

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
a different color text just to make the comments stand out.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
However, if I run this, it's had no impact

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
on what our program does.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
All right, it still says Hello World one, two and three.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
All right, but if I go down to the next line here

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and put a double slash in front of that,

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
all right, that line is now ignored by the compiler.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Right, so if I go ahead and run this,

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I get Hello World one, Hello World three.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
All right, so it allows again to just kind of have this

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
comment only exists for a single line.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All right, and of course, these comments can

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
also be on a line by themselves.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If I had a line here, I would just type something like,

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
this is a standalone comment.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
All right, and go ahead and run this guy again.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All right, and no change in the output,

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
because again, the comment lasts until the end of the line.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
All right, now block comments actually

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
have distinct starting and ending points, right?

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So, if before this message here, if I put a slash, star,

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that comment exists until the star, slash.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Right, so I can say, this is the first line of the comment,

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
all right, and I can even add another line and say,

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
this is the second line of the comment.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And, I can have as many of these lines here as I want to

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
because a comment doesn't end until it gets

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to the star, slash.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Using that same technique, block comments can start

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and end in the middle of the same line, all right?

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So if I just wanted to change this text here,

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
but not delete it, so I do a slash, star,

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and I put a star, slash at the end.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And now, I put in here, this is different text,

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
everything between the slash, star and star, slash

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
is ignored, but then once we hit the end of the block

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
comment, compiler looks at it again.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Or, I should say the compiler sees the text again.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All right, so if I go over here and I run this now,

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I get my Hello World one, but then,

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I get the, this is different text.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All right, and so the really key thing is that

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the slash, slash comment just exists

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
until the very end of the line.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The block comments have distinct starting

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and ending points.

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
One thing to be aware of block comments

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
is that you cannot nest them, all right.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, I got a block comment here at the top

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
but this is the first line of the comment,

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
this is the second line of the comment.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If I put a slash, star in here,

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
you notice that at that second star, slash,

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the one at the bottom now shows up as an error,

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
because the compiler doesn't have a distinct

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
idea of for every starting block comment,

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
there is an ending block.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Basically, as soon as it sees the very first encounter

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
of star, slash, all the comments are ended.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, you cannot nest block comments.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now, it is okay to put line comments

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
inside of a block comment.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So, if I put a slash, slash line comment in here,

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
all right, that's not an error.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You wouldn't intentionally do that really,

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
because you're already in the comment block,

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
so why put a line comment in there?

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But, if you happen to have an existing line comment

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and you wrap it in a block comment, that's still safe.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The bottom line here is that comments allow us

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
to put text inside of our source code

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
that we don't want to be seen by the compiler,

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
all right, whether it's notes to ourselves

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
or another human being, or we just want certain

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:59:00,000
source code to be ignored for some period of time.
