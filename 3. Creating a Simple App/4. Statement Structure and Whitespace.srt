1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Java programs are made up of statements.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, a lot of different things can

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
go on in a particular statement.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And, we'll talk about those things throughout this course.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But fundamentally, programs are made up of statements.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, each statement ends with a semicolon, right?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Java's a language where the new line and the Enter key

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
doesn't really create a new statement, right?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It actually (mumbles) on the semicolon.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you're going from any of the C-based languages,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that's something you're very familiar with, right?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Other languages, like Visual Basic, actually use

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the end of the end of line to mark a statement.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In Java, it's the semicolon.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And the parts of a statement can be separated

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
by zero or more whitespaces, right?

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, and a whitespace can be many different things.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It can be the Space character.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It can be a Tab.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And because statements don't end with new line,

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
even the new line itself is just a whitespace in Java.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Java's a language that gives us a lot of flexibility

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
with whitespaces.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Because, remember we said that the parts can be

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
separated by zero or more whitespaces.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, it allows us to format things in a way

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that works well for us, right?

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, I can have a statement like this where all of the parts

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
are pushed all together with no whitespaces

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
between them.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But then, I can have the same statement

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
where I just put a space after the Print line,

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and a space after the parenthesis,

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and a space before the other parenthesis.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That will do the exact same thing.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I can even put multiple spaces in there, right,

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and that still does the exact same thing.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And, remember that because the new line

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
is considered a whitespace, I can even format

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
it like this, right?

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now, this is kind of a crazy way to format it

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and I wouldn't suggest you do this.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But, it's all just whitespace, all right?

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So, after that Print line, we've got a new line,

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
followed by a bunch of the Space characters.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's fine.

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
All right, after that parenthesis, we got a new line again.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
After Hello World, we got a new line, another new line,

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and then, a whole bunch of whitespaces.

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All right, so (mumbles) a whole bunch of Space character.

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And so, it just shows us that the whitespace allows us

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to indent, format, put line breaks

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
in a way that works for us, right?

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The whitespaces are just separators.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And, it's that semicolon that marks the end of the statement.
