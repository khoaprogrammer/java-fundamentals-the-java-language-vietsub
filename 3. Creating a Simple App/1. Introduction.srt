00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to this module on creating a simple app.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Jim Wilson.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this module, first we're going to look at creating

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
your very first IntelliJ project.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In other words, how we create a simple

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
application using IntelliJ.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We'll then look at running our Java programs

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
from the command line.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We'll take a look at the syntax of Java

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
statements and comments.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We'll introduce the concept of Java packages.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And then, we'll walk through creating and running

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
a project using the NetBeans IDE.
